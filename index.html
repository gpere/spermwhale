  <h1>How Sperm Whales use Waves</h1>
    <h4>Sperm whales use waves for two main porpuses. The first one is that they use them to find their way around. They do this by
    making a sound using a form of larnyx. However, scienstists are still unsure of the exact way they make their clicks,
    only that it is different from the way that humans use it because they do not exhale to make noises. The other way that they use waves is
    for communication. They emit a series of clicks and hums to find potential mates and to not be lonely.
    <br>
    <br>
      These clicks and hums can reach an asotnationing 230 decibels, this makes them the loudest mammal on earth.
      Because waves travel through water different than they do in air the whales would be a still extremely loud 174 decibels in the air on land.
      For reference to all of these different decibel levels, a jet from 100 feet away produces about 140 decibels.
      At around 150 decibels your eardrums can burst and at 180-200+ decibels is thought to be the range where death can happen.
      One example of damage to a person caused by the whale’s extremely loud form of communication is that in one of James Nestor’s talks he told a story of a fellow diver that on one dive stuck his hand out in front of himself to protect himself from a whale that was getting a bit too close. His hand was paralyzed for four hours from the blast of sound that he experienced.
      These clicks besides from being incredibly loud and possibly deadly, they can travel for hundreds or even thousands of miles. It has also been found that these whales actually have different accents depending on their location.
