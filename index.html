  <h1>How Sperm Whales use Waves</h1>
    <h4>Sperm whales use waves for two main porpuses. The first one is that they use them to find their way around. They do this by
    making a sound using a form of larnyx. However, scienstists are still unsure of the exact way they make their clicks,
    only that it is different from the way that humans use it because they do not exhale to make noises. The other way that they use waves is
    for communication. They emit a series of clicks and hums to find potential mates and to not be lonely.</h4>
